    "Quantum algorithms are step-by-step instructions designed to be executed on a quantum computer, leveraging quantum principles like superposition and entanglement to potentially solve problems faster than classical algorithms. They are crucial for tasks where classical computers struggle, such as factoring large numbers and simulating quantum systems. While all classical algorithms can be run on a quantum computer, the term \"quantum algorithm\" usually refers to algorithms that exploit unique quantum features. \n",
